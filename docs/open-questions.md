### Q12. The Hub/MDE proposal document
D28 makes the proposal the ground truth for the final product, but it isn't in the repo.
Add it as `docs/proposal.pdf` (or .docx) so requirements can be checked against it.

## Needs John (not decisions)
- First source files (WWC foundational skills guide 2016, NRP "Teaching Children to Read"
  2000, MS CCRS for ELA): save to `corpus/` and send the download URLs.
- AWS OpenSearch Serverless test: John sets it up, then says go.
